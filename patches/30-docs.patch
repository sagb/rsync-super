 rsync - a fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool
 
+## CAUTION
+
+This is rsync-super, a fork allowing chroot in SSH mode.
+
+It adds six mandatory arguments, which must be specified first and in fixed order:
+
+`--chroot-dir`, `--chroot-uid`, `--chroot-gid`
+
+On startup, rsync immediately and unconditionally performs chroot to the specified
+directory and drops privileges.
+
+You **must** read README.md before using it.
